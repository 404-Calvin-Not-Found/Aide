## 🧠 Aide — Because Google Deserved a Shortcut

**Tired of copy-pasting text into a new tab just to figure out what the author was trying to say with that one painfully long sentence?** Meet **Aide** — your passive-aggressive little browser assistant who *won’t judge your vocabulary* (but secretly might).

### 🚀 What is Aide?

**Aide** is a lightweight browser extension designed to make your life easier — or at least, less filled with unnecessary tab-hopping. Just select any confusing, cryptic, or overly-complicated passage of text from *any* website, and boom — Aide swoops in with a contextual meaning search. No typing. No tabs. No drama.

Think of it as the smart friend who helps you cheat in class — *except it’s legal, fast, and won’t ghost you later*.

### 🧰 Features

* 🔍 **Instant Search**: Select a block of text, right-click (or press your magic shortcut), and Aide will search the selected passage using your preferred search engine.
* 💡 **Context-Aware**: Doesn’t just highlight a word — it grabs entire passages so you can finally understand what that corporate blog post was trying to say.
* ⚡ **Lightning-Fast**: It’s like Google, but without the 3 seconds of typing. Time saved? Probably enough to finally take a lunch break.
* 🎯 **Cross-Site Compatible**: Works on pretty much any website. Even the sketchy ones (but you didn’t hear that from us).
* 🛠️ **Customizable** (Coming Soon™): Set your own search engine, change shortcut keys, maybe even teach it sarcasm.

### 🧑‍💻 Who is This For?

* Students trying to decipher academic lingo without crying.
* Professionals needing to sound smart *without actually reading everything*.
* Casual readers tired of phrases like “synergistic scalability enhancement paradigm.”

### 🛸 How Does It Work?

1. Highlight any text on a webpage.
2. Right-click or press the Aide shortcut.
3. Aide opens a new tab, performs a search, and explains things like a cool English teacher.
4. You pretend you knew it all along.

### 📦 Installation

Clone it, zip it, and load it as an unpacked extension in your browser. Or wait till it's live on the Chrome Web Store (because you're too cool for manual installs).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/404-Calvin-Not-Found/Aide
```

Then:

* Go to `chrome://extensions/`
* Enable "Developer Mode"
* Click "Load Unpacked"
* Select the project folder

Boom. Aide is at your service.

### 🤓 Tech Stack

* Gemini 2.0 (because ChatGPT is costly)
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* A strong dislike for manual Googling

### 🪛 Coming Soon

* Search engine selection (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing — no judgment)
* Dark mode (for goth developers)
* Keyboard shortcut customization
* A sassier pop-up message when you highlight obvious stuff

### 🤷 Why Aide?

Because in 2025, nobody should still be manually opening a new tab just to ask “what does this mean?”. You have better things to do. Like procrastinate more efficiently.
